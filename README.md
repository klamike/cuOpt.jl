# cuOpt.jl

[cuOpt.jl](https://github.com/jump-dev/cuOpt.jl) is a wrapper for [NVIDIA cuOpt](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuOpt),
a GPU-accelerated Optimization Engine.

The package has two components:

 - a thin wrapper around the complete C API
 - an interface to [MathOptInterface](https://github.com/jump-dev/MathOptInterface.jl)

## Affiliation

This wrapper is developed and maintained by NVIDIA with help from the JuMP community.

## Getting Help

For assistance, please post your questions on the [JuMP community forum](https://jump.dev/forum).

If you encounter a reproducible bug, feel free to open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/jump-dev/cuOpt.jl/issues).

## License

`cuOpt.jl` is licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://github.com/jump-dev/cuOpt.jl/blob/master/LICENSE).

## System Requirements

Please refer to [NVIDIA cuOpt system requirements](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuopt/user-guide/latest/system-requirements.html).

## Installation

To use cuOpt.jl, you must first separately install cuOpt.

**Installing cuOpt requires Linux.**

Note: This version of cuOpt.jl supports the Nvidia cuOpt 26.04 release and the
26.06 development library built from source. The batch LP interface requires the
26.06 development library.

Please refer to the [NVIDIA cuOpt documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuopt/user-guide/latest/cuopt-c/quick-start.html#installation) for installation instructions.

Please ensure the library path for `libcuopt.so` is added to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

Once cuOpt is installed, add cuOpt.jl as follows:
```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.add("cuOpt")
```

### Colab

To install cuOpt on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), do:
```julia
julia> cmd = run(`pip install --extra-index-url=https://pypi.nvidia.com libcuopt-cu12==26.4.\* nvidia-cuda-runtime-cu12==12.8.\*`);

julia> push!(Base.DL_LOAD_PATH, "/usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages/libcuopt/lib64")
```

## Use with JuMP

To use NVIDIA cuOpt with JuMP, use `cuOpt.Optimizer`:

```julia
using JuMP, cuOpt
model = Model(cuOpt.Optimizer)
@variable(model, x >= 0)
@variable(model, 0 <= y <= 3)
@objective(model, Min, 12x + 20y)
@constraint(model, 6x + 8y >= 100)
@constraint(model, 7x + 12y >= 120)
optimize!(model)
```
